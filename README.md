# simject

simject is a command-line tool and iOS dynamic library that allows developers to easily test their tweaks on the iOS Simulator.

simject is BSD-licensed. See `LICENSE` for more information.

### simject setup (requires the latest version of [Theos](https://github.com/theos/theos))

1. `git clone https://github.com/angelXwind/simject.git`

1. `cd simject/`

1. `make setup`

1. Note: During the process, you will be asked by `sudo` to enter in your login password. Please note that it is normal for nothing to be displayed as you type your password.

### simject usage

1. Place your dynamic libraries and accompanying property lists inside `/opt/simject` to load them in the iOS Simulator. Do not delete `simject.plist` or `simject.dylib`.

1. Inside the `bin` subdirectory, you will find the `simspring` command-line tool. Execute it to cause a booted iOS Simulator to respring and be able to load tweaks.

1. You will need to run `simspring` every time the device reboots or if SpringBoard crashes.

1. Happy developing! (And don't make SpringBoard cry *too* hard... it has feelings, too! Probably.)

### Targeting the iOS Simulator

1. Open your project's `Makefile`.

1. Change your `TARGET` variable to `TARGET = simulator:clang` (you may optionally specify the SDK/deployment versions)

1. If you want to support 32-bit iOS Simulators (in addition to 64-bit), add `ARCH = x86_64 i386` to your Makefile. If you are fine without 32-bit support, then simply add `ARCH = x86_64`.

1. `make` your project and copy `.theos/obj/iphone_simulator/$YOUR_TWEAK.dylib` to `/opt/simject/$YOUR_TWEAK.dylib`

1. Also make sure to copy `$YOUR_TWEAK.plist` to `/opt/simject/$YOUR_TWEAK.plist`. simject will not load your tweak if you miss this step!

1. An example tweak project is available in the `simjectExampleTweak/` subfolder. Use it as reference if you want.

### Final notes

Do keep in mind that just because your tweak works in the Simulator doesn't necessarily mean it'll work on an actual iOS device. Yes, in 99% of cases, it will work just fine, but there will always be some strange edge cases where this does not apply.

Also, special thanks to PoomSmart, who told me about the existence of `-[SBApplicationInfo environmentVariables]`, which is crucial to how simject works.
